if right wall sensor detects collision, move to where it's visually one to the left, inverse for the left wall sensor
if both wall sensors are active, move in opposite direction of what's held.

If any ceiling sensor detects collision, stop moving up
if any floor sensor detects collsion, stop falling.
if both floor and ceiling sensors detect collision:
    if there is enough space to spin, spin into the ball.
    if there isn't enough space to change into the ball state, then kill the character.
